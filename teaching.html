          <p> I regularly teach in data science and American politics at the graduate, undergraduate, and high school levels. For example, I designed my own course on <a href="docs/gov97_syllabus.pdf">US Local Policymaking</a> in Spring 2022 for Harvard undergraduates, re-designed the <a href="teaching.html">summer data science training</a> for <a href="https://www.hks.harvard.edu/educational-programs/masters-programs/master-public-administration-international-development">MPA/ID</a> students at the Harvard Kennedy School in 2022, and created an <a href="syllabus.html">Introduction to Data Science</a> (in R) in Summer 2021 for high school students in New Jersey. During graduate school, I have also served as a Teaching Fellow for several courses on statistics, American politics, and computational social science.</p>

                        <em> The goal of this course is to prepare you to analyze public policy issues using statistics. Key topics in the course are in the areas of probability theory, estimation, hypothesis testing, regression analysis, causal inference and prediction. While many students taking this class will have already taken courses in statistical inference and regression analysis, this course will place a much stronger emphasis than typical courses on conceptually understanding the underlying methods. Since the course is targeted to first - year students in t he MPA - ID program, we will not shy away from using mathematical tools, but the emphasis of the course will be on the conceptual understanding and application of the tools rather than on the math or the mechanics behind the tools. So for example, when study ing hypothesis testing, we will place a heavier emphasis on what the test is doing, when to use it and how to interpret its results, than on mathematical proofs underpinning the test or on mechanical repetitions of the calculations involved in conducting the test.</em>

But local politics is different in many ways from the federal politics of presidents and senators that we are used to hearing about every day. Who has power in America’s nearly 100,000 local governments? How are decisions made by entities like city councils and school boards, and how can political change happen at the ground level? More generally, how can we use political science as a discipline to inform how we can impact our own communities? </em>
