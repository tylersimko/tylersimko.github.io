                            <em> Schools in the United States remain heavily segregated by race and income. Previous
                                work demonstrates districts can reduce segregation between their schools with policies
                                like redrawing attendance zones. Yet, the promise of such policies in many areas is
                                limited by the fact that most school segregation occurs between school districts, and
                                not between schools in the same district. I adapt Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)
                                algorithms from political redistricting methodology to redraw school district boundaries
                                that decrease
                                segregation while maintaining desirable criteria like distance to school and using only
                                existing school
                                facilities. Focusing on New Jersey, where the segregation of Black and Hispanic students
                                from White and
                                Asian students is among the worst in the country, I demonstrate that redrawing school
                                districts could reduce
                                nearly 40% of existing segregation in the median New Jersey county, compared to less
                                than 5% for redrawing
                                attendance zones alone. Finally, I show how my proposed methodology can be applied to as
                                few as two
                                districts to reduce segregation in proposed “mergers,” a consolidation of small
                                districts into one large district.</em>

                            <em> Congressional district lines in many U.S. states are drawn by partisan actors, raising
                                concerns about gerrymandering. To isolate the electoral impact of gerrymandering from
                                the effects of other factors including geography and redistricting rules, we compare
                                predicted election outcomes under the enacted plan with those under a large sample of
                                non-partisan, simulated alternative plans for all states. We find that partisan
                                gerrymandering is widespread in the 2020 redistricting cycle, but most of the bias it
                                creates cancels at the national level, giving Republicans two additional seats, on
                                average. In contrast, moderate pro-Republican bias due to geography and redistricting
                                rules remains. Finally, we find that partisan gerrymandering reduces electoral
                                competition and makes the House's partisan composition less responsive to shifts in the
                                national vote.</em>

                            <em> Despite the fundamental importance of American local governments for service provision
                                in areas like education and public health, local policy-making remains difficult and
                                expensive to study at scale due to a lack of centralized data. This article introduces
                                LocalView, the largest existing dataset of real-time local government public meetings --
                                the central policy-making process in local government. In sum, the dataset currently
                                covers 139,616 videos and their corresponding textual and audio transcripts of local
                                government meetings publicly uploaded to YouTube -- the world's largest public
                                video-sharing website -- from 1,012 places and 2,861 distinct governments across the
                                United States between 2006-2022. The data are processed, downloaded, cleaned, and
                                publicly disseminated at <a href="https://localview.net">localview.net</a> for analysis
                                across places and over time. We validate this dataset using a variety of methods and
                                demonstrate how it can be used to map local governments' attention to policy areas of
                                interest. Finally, we discuss how LocalView may be used by journalists, academics, and
                                other users for understanding how local communities deliberate crucial policy questions
                                on topics including climate change, public health, and immigration.</em>
