            <p> I'm an undergraduate in the Department of Politics at Princeton University who specializes in <a href="https://sml.princeton.edu/" target="_blank">Statistics &amp; Machine Learning.</a> This fall  (2017), I will apply to PhD programs to study political methodology with substantive focuses on local politics and education policy. My first substantial working paper focuses on a randomized experiment that I performed during my re-election campaign for local office; to the best of my knowledge, it is the first example of self-experimentation in political science. </p>

            <p> I'm currently serving my fifth year as an elected member of the <a href="http://www.sapublicschools.com/"> South Amboy Board of Education</a>, for which I was re-elected in the fall of 2016. These days, I can be found saying things at <a href="http://www.sapublicschools.com/board/minutes">Education &amp; Curriculum, Budget &amp; Finance, and Technology committee meetings. </a> </p>

            <p> I spend a lot of my time working as a researcher, most recently at <a href="https://www.princeton.edu/news/2017/05/04/twelve-princeton-students-selected-international-streicker-fellows">The University of Tokyo</a>. Most of this involves programming in R / Python and trying to understand some math. Over the summers at Princeton I serve on the teaching staff for <a href="https://registrar.princeton.edu/course-offerings/summer/course_details.xml?courseid=012511&term=1181"> POL245: Visualizing Data</a>, during which we teach incoming freshman R programming, basic causal inference, and introductory statistics in six weeks (really!).</p>
 
            <p> My side gig is playing the organ on weekends (one of <a href="images/organ.JPG" alt="Tyler Simko pipe organ" target="_blank">these things)</a>.</p>

            <p> If you have any questions / comments or if you are a South Amboy resident who would like to talk about our public schools, here is my e-mail: <a href="mailto:tylersimko@gmail.com">tylersimko@gmail.com</a>.</p>
