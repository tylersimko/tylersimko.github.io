                        <em> Congressional district lines in many U.S. states are drawn by partisan actors, raising
                            concerns about gerrymandering. To isolate the electoral impact of gerrymandering from
                            the effects of other factors including geography and redistricting rules, we compare
                            predicted election outcomes under the enacted plan with those under a large sample of
                            non-partisan, simulated alternative plans for all states. We find that partisan
                            gerrymandering is widespread in the 2020 redistricting cycle, but most of the bias it
                            creates cancels at the national level, giving Republicans two additional seats, on
                            average. In contrast, moderate pro-Republican bias due to geography and redistricting
                            rules remains. Finally, we find that partisan gerrymandering reduces electoral
                            competition and makes the House's partisan composition less responsive to shifts in the
                            national vote.</em>

                            <em> For the 2020 decennial census, the Census Bureau adopted a new Disclosure Avoidance
                                System (DAS) based on differential privacy. The DAS was designed to protect the
                                confidentiality of responses by injecting statistical noise into a confidential
                                individual census dataset. A key output of this system is the Noisy Measurement File
                                (NMF), which is produced by adding random noise to tabulated statistics. The resulting
                                Noisy Measurement File (NMF) is an invaluable resource for Census data users to
                                understand the error introduced by the DAS and perform statistically valid analyses that
                                properly account for DAS-introduced error.

                                The Bureau did not initially release the NMF, but released a demonstration version in
                                April 2023 after several public requests and subsequent litigation. The Bureau plans to
                                release the NMF for the P.L.94-171 redistricting data and more detailed census data (the
                                DHC file) later this year.

                                We commend the Bureau's decision to provide the NMF, which will help advance social
                                science research, improve policy decisions, and further strengthen the DAS itself. To
                                maximize the benefits of the released NMF, however, we believe that the Bureau must
                                substantially improve the way in which the NMF is formatted and released. In a letter
                                recently published in Science, we explain several obstacles researchers may face when
                                accessing, processing, and using the demonstration data for statistical analyses.</em>

                            <em> Despite the fundamental importance of American local governments for service provision
                                in areas like education and public health, local policy-making remains difficult and
                                expensive to study at scale due to a lack of centralized data. This article introduces
                                LocalView, the largest existing dataset of real-time local government public meetings --
                                the central policy-making process in local government. In sum, the dataset currently
                                covers 139,616 videos and their corresponding textual and audio transcripts of local
                                government meetings publicly uploaded to YouTube -- the world's largest public
                                video-sharing website -- from 1,012 places and 2,861 distinct governments across the
                                United States between 2006-2022. The data are processed, downloaded, cleaned, and
                                publicly disseminated at <a href="https://localview.net">localview.net</a> for analysis
                                across places and over time. We validate this dataset using a variety of methods and
                                demonstrate how it can be used to map local governments' attention to policy areas of
                                interest. Finally, we discuss how LocalView may be used by journalists, academics, and
                                other users for understanding how local communities deliberate crucial policy questions
                                on topics including climate change, public health, and immigration.</em>

                            <em> In "Differential Perspectives: Epistemic Disconnects Surrounding the US Census Bureau's
                                Use of Differential Privacy," boyd and Sarathy argue that empirical evaluations of the
                                Census Disclosure Avoidance System (DAS), including our published analysis, failed to
                                recognize how the benchmark data against which the 2020 DAS was evaluated is never a
                                ground truth of population counts. In this commentary, we explain why policy evaluation,
                                which was the main goal of our analysis, is still meaningful without access to a perfect
                                ground truth. We also point out that our evaluation leveraged features specific to the
                                decennial Census and redistricting data, such as block-level population invariance under
                                swapping and voter file racial identification, better approximating a comparison with
                                the ground truth. Lastly, we show that accurate statistical predictions of individual
                                race based on the Bayesian Improved Surname Geocoding, while not a violation of
                                differential privacy, substantially increases the disclosure risk of private information
                                the Census Bureau sought to protect. We conclude by arguing that policy makers must
                                confront a key trade-off between data utility and privacy protection, and an epistemic
                                disconnect alone is insufficient to explain disagreements between policy choices.</em>

                            <em> This article introduces the 50stateSimulations, a collection of simulated congressional
                                districting plans and underlying code developed by the Algorithm-Assisted Redistricting
                                Methodology (ALARM) Project. The 50stateSimulations allow for the evaluation of enacted
                                and other congressional redistricting plans in the United States. While the use of
                                redistricting simulation algorithms has become standard in academic research and court
                                cases, any simulation analysis requires non-trivial eforts to combine multiple data
                                sets, identify state-specifc redistricting criteria, implement complex simulation
                                algorithms, and summarize and visualize simulation outputs. We have developed a complete
                                workfow that facilitates this entire process of simulation-based redistricting analysis
                                for the congressional districts of all 50 states. The resulting 50stateSimulations
                                include ensembles of simulated 2020 congressional redistricting plans and necessary
                                replication data. We also provide the underlying code, which serves as a template for
                                customized analyses. All data and code are free and publicly available. This article

                            <em> We study presidential patronage as a form of distributive politics. To do so, we
                                introduce comprehensive data on supervisory personnel in the executive branch between
                                1925 and 1959 and link each bureaucrat to the congressional representative from their
                                home district. We identify testable hypotheses regarding the impact of electoral
                                considerations, partisanship, and legislative support on the distribution of
                                bureaucratic appointments across districts. Results from a variety of fixed-effects
                                estimation strategies are consistent with several forms of presidential patronage. Our
                                results provide initial evidence about the mechanisms through which patronage
                                appointments are administered in the executive branch and illustrate how presidential

                            <em> Census statistics play a key role in public policy decisions and social science
                                research. Yet given the risk of revealing individual information, many statistical
                                agencies are considering disclosure control methods based on differential privacy, which
                                add noise to tabulated data. Unlike other applications of differential privacy, however,
                                census statistics must be post-processed after noise injection to be usable. We study
                                the impact of the US Census Bureau's new Disclosure Avoidance System (DAS) on a major
                                application of census statistics: the redrawing of electoral districts. We find that the
                                DAS systematically undercounts the population in mixed-race and mixed-partisan
                                precincts, yielding unpredictable racial and partisan biases. The DAS also leads to a
                                likely violation of "One Person, One Vote" standard as currently interpreted, but does
                                not prevent accurate predictions of an individual's race and ethnicity. Our findings
                                underscore the difficulty of balancing accuracy and respondent privacy in the
                                Census.</em>

                        <em> We examine the effects of a “fact-specific proxy” (FSP) introduced by Virginia’s
                            Department of Housing and Community Development (VA DHCD) to broaden and streamline
                            access to assistance. The FSP used the applicant’s ZIP code as a proxy for income
                            eligibility, simplifying the requirement of documenting income eligibility for some
                            applicants and not others. Simplifying income eligibility verification represents a
                            substantial documentation burden reduction. Our general goal in the project is to ask:
                            to what extent does simplifying the individual requirement to document income
                            eligibility for applicants in relevant zip codes increase applications (especially among
                            underserved groups) and reduce processing times? We analyze application data aggregated
                            to the ZIP code level in order to answer this question.</em>

                            <em>
                                <p>On January 31, 2019, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), the
                                    U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York (SDNY within DOJ), the
                                    New York City Housing Authority (NYCHA), and New York City (the City) signed an
                                    agreement to help NYCHA significantly improve housing conditions for its residents.
                                    Housing conditions targeted for improvement ranged from lead paint to heat to pest
                                    infestations. In turn, unsafe housing conditions can harm public housing residents'
                                    health, increasing their risk for conditions such as childhood and adult asthma.</p>

                                <p>Measuring improvement in pest conditions is difficult because there was no “pest
                                    census” at the time of the agreement—that is, no complete account of the presence or
                                    absence of pests in all units, buildings, and developments. Meanwhile, the
                                    administrative agreement requires that NYCHA reduces its pest population by certain
                                    magnitudes (e.g., 40-50% depending on the pest type), which makes it important to
                                    obtain unbiased measures of pest prevalence. Our collaboration focused on
                                    methodologies that could be used to monitor: (1) the baseline levels of pest
                                    infestations at the beginning of the legal oversight and (2) whether there are
                                    improvements over time. We explored the pros and cons of four strategies for
                                    estimating this prevalence: (1) using tenant-submitted work orders as measures of
                                    underlying issues, (2) using results from randomly-scheduled inspections, (3) using
                                    results from randomly-scheduled inspections but reweighting these results to account
                                    for unequal probabilities of being selected for an inspection and agreeing to have
                                    one's unit inspected, and (4) using predictive modeling to see whether we can
                                    predict inspection results using many predictors (e.g., work order history; building
                                    characteristics). We are preparing a manuscript that discusses broader lessons for
                                    the role of data science in monitoring compliance with legal oversight and provides
                                    recommendations for academics and policymakers</p>

                            <em> A large body of research documents the barriers faced by first-generation, low-income
                                (FGLI) students as ``hidden minorities'' on elite college campuses. Although existing
                                studies show brief psychological interventions can help mitigate some of these
                                obstacles, universities are investing in more intensive interventions that try to both
                                shift mindsets and mitigate structural disadvantages in FGLI students' academic
                                preparation. In collaboration with the administrators at a highly selective university,
                                we conducted the first randomized controlled trial of a summer bridge program targeted
                                primarily at FGLI students. We are actively preparing a manuscript estimating
