                            <em> Many of the most tangible and immediate political conflicts in Americans’ lives occur
                                at the local level. Yet, we lack large-scale evidence on how, why, and where conflict
                                occurs in local governments. In this article, we present a new dataset of nearly 100,000
                                videos of school board meetings, and use them to create a new measure of local political
                                conflict. We validate this new approach using sentiment analysis and structural topic
                                modeling. We then document consistent results: conflict in school board meetings occurs
                                at some point for most boards and has become more common since 2020, but the most
                                intense conflicts are concentrated in a small number of districts; this conflict often
                                centers cultural issues like racial diversity and gender identity. We then show that
                                conflict, particularly cultural conflict, is most likely to occur in larger school
                                districts in cities and suburbs and in places with more White students.</em>

                            <em> Neighborhoods are frequently cited as impactful for social, economic, political, and
                                health outcomes. Measuring neighborhoods, however, is challenging, as the definition of
                                a neighborhood may change dramatically across places. Researchers lack widespread but
                                locally-sourced data on neighborhoods, and instead often adopt widely available but
                                arbitrary Census geographies as neighborhood proxies. Others invest in the collection of
                                more precise definitions, but these types of data are hard to collect at scale. We
                                address this tension between scale and precision by collecting, cleaning, and providing
                                to researchers a new dataset of city-defined neighborhoods. Our data includes 206 of the
                                largest cities in the United States, covering more than 77 million people. We combine
                                these data with block-level Census demographic data and provide them along with
                                open-source software to aid researchers in their use.</em>

                            <em> Most US school districts draw geographic "attendance zones" to assign children to
                                schools based on their home address, a process that can replicate existing neighborhood
                                racial/ethnic and socioeconomic status (SES) segregation in schools. Redrawing
                                boundaries can reduce segregation, but estimating expected rezoning impacts is often
                                challenging because families can opt-out of their assigned schools. This paper seeks to
                                alleviate this societal problem by developing a joint redistricting and choice modeling
                                framework, called redistricting with choices (RWC). The RWC framework is applied to a
                                large US public school district to estimate how redrawing elementary school boundaries
                                might realistically impact levels of socioeconomic segregation. The main methodological
                                contribution of RWC is a contextual stochastic optimization model that aims to minimize
                                district-wide segregation by integrating rezoning constraints with a machine
                                learning-based school choice model. The study finds that RWC yields boundary changes
                                that might reduce segregation by a substantial amount (23%) -- but doing so might
                                require the re-assignment of a large number of students, likely to mitigate
                                re-segregation that choice patterns could exacerbate. The results also reveal that
                                predicting school choice is a challenging machine learning problem. Overall, this study
                                offers a novel practical framework that both academics and policymakers might use to
                                foster more diverse and integrated schools.</em>

                            <em> The vast majority of US public school districts use school attendance boundaries to
                                determine which student addresses are
                                assigned to which schools. Existing work shows how redrawing boundaries can be a
                                powerful policy lever for increasing access
                                and opportunity for historically disadvantaged groups, even while maintaining other
                                priorities like minimizing driving
                                distances and preserving existing social ties between students and families. This study
                                introduces a multi-objective
                                algorithmic school rezoning framework and applies it to a large-scale rezoning effort
                                impacting over 50,000 students through
                                an ongoing researcher-school district partnership. The framework is designed to
                                incorporate feedback from community
                                members and policymakers, both by deciding which goals are optimized and also by placing
                                differential ``importance'' on
                                goals through weights from community surveys. Empirical results reveal the framework's
                                ability to surface school redistricting
                                plans that simultaneously advance a number of objectives often thought to be in
                                competition with one another, including
                                socioeconomic integration, transportation efficiency, and stable feeder patterns
                                (transitions) between elementary, middle, and
                                high schools. The paper also highlights how local education policymakers navigate
                                several practical challenges, like building
                                political will to make change in a polarized policy climate. The framework is built
                                using open-source tools and publicly released
                                to support school districts in exploring and implementing new policies to improve
                                educational access and opportunity in the
                                coming years.</em>

                            <em> A large body of research documents the barriers faced by first-generation, low-income
                                (FGLI) students as “hidden minorities” on elite college campuses. Although existing
                                studies
                                show brief psychological interventions can help mitigate some of these obstacles,
                                universities are investing in more intensive interventions that try to both shift
                                mindsets
                                and mitigate structural disadvantages in FGLI students’ academic preparation. In
                                collaboration with the administrators at a highly selective university, we conducted a
                                randomized controlled trial of a summer bridge program targeted at FGLI students. During
                                summers between 2017 and 2019, we randomly selected 232 out of 418 first-generation or
                                low-income students and invited them to attend an intensive, six-week-long residential
                                summer program featuring courses for academic credit. Students randomized to the control
                                group either interacted with online content offering no academic credit or had no summer
                                intervention. Our preregistered analysis shows that the program encouraged FGLI students
                                to
                                pursue a more ambitious first-year program, increasing the proportion of nonintroductory
                                courses by 7 percentage points. The program also increased the proportion of courses
                                taken
                                for a grade rather than as pass-fail by 6 percentage points. These improvements were
                                accompanied by no discernible impact on first-year grade point averages (GPAs) and
                                academic
                                withdrawal. The findings show the potential to academically integrate FGLI students into
                                selective university communities.</em>

                            <em> A large-scale study of US local policymaking has long been hindered by a lack of
                                centralized data sources. Our own project, LocalView, supplements data collection
                                efforts by creating the largest existing database of local government meeting
                                transcripts, audio, and video yet released. In this article, we describe promises,
                                implications, and best practices for using nontabular sources of meeting data in the
                                study of federalism. Throughout, we argue that these new sources of data allow scholars
                                to ask new kinds of research questions. We demonstrate this potential with an empirical
                                application focused on the use of national partisan language in local government
                                meetings. We find that nationally salient partisan phrases are common in local
                                policymaking discussions (especially in large cities), although prominent national terms
                                vary drastically in how often they are used at the local level. Finally, the slant of
                                partisan language (i.e., the amount of partisan language that is identifiably Democratic
                                or Republican) across local governments is correlated with local partisan
                                preferences.</em>

                            <em> Schools in the United States remain heavily segregated by race and income. Previous
                                work demonstrates districts can promote group diversity within their schools with
                                policies like redrawing attendance zones. Yet, the promise of such policies in many
                                areas is limited by the fact that most school segregation occurs between school
                                districts, and not between schools in the same district. I adapt Markov Chain Monte
                                Carlo algorithms from legislative redistricting to redraw school district boundaries
                                that decrease segregation while maintaining desirable criteria like distance to school
                                and using only existing school facilities. Focusing on New Jersey, where the segregation
                                of Black and Hispanic students from White and Asian students is among the worst in the
                                country, I demonstrate that redrawing school districts could reduce more than 40% of
                                existing segregation in the median New Jersey county, compared to less than 5% for
                                redrawing attendance zones alone. Finally, I show how my proposed methodology can be
                                applied to as few as two districts to reduce segregation in proposed consolidations,
                                when small districts are merged into a larger district.</em>

                            <em> The United States Census Bureau faces a difficult trade-off between the accuracy of
                                Census statistics and the protection of individual information. We conduct the first
                                independent evaluation of bias and noise induced by the Bureau's two main disclosure
                                avoidance systems: the TopDown algorithm employed for the 2020 Census and the swapping
                                algorithm implemented for the 1990, 2000, and 2010 Censuses. Our evaluation leverages
                                the recent release of the Noisy Measure File (NMF) as well as the availability of two
                                independent runs of the TopDown algorithm applied to the 2010 decennial Census. We find
                                that the NMF contains too much noise to be directly useful alone, especially for
                                Hispanic and multiracial populations. TopDown's post-processing dramatically reduces the
                                NMF noise and produces similarly accurate data to swapping in terms of bias and noise.
                                These patterns hold across census geographies with varying population sizes and racial
                                diversity. While the estimated errors for both TopDown and swapping are generally no
                                larger than other sources of Census error, they can be relatively substantial for
                                geographies with small total populations.</em>

                            <em> The U.S. government administers many public programs and services. Creating programs
                                that work requires an understanding of the psychological processes that influence
                                behavior. To this end, policymakers may collaborate with academics who have expertise in
                                behavioral science to generate ideas for improving existing programs, procedures, or
                                policies; to test existing programs; or to design wholly new programs that address
                                societal problems. Such collaborations also enable academics to test new or established
                                theories in real-world settings. In this article, we draw on our collective experience

                            <em> Congressional district lines in many U.S. states are drawn by partisan actors, raising
                                concerns about gerrymandering. To isolate the electoral impact of gerrymandering from
                                the effects of other factors including geography and redistricting rules, we compare
                                predicted election outcomes under the enacted plan with those under a large sample of
                                non-partisan, simulated alternative plans for all states. We find that partisan
                                gerrymandering is widespread in the 2020 redistricting cycle, but most of the bias it
                                creates cancels at the national level, giving Republicans two additional seats, on
                                average. In contrast, moderate pro-Republican bias due to geography and redistricting
                                rules remains. Finally, we find that partisan gerrymandering reduces electoral
                                competition and makes the House's partisan composition less responsive to shifts in the
                                national vote.</em>

                            <em> For the 2020 decennial census, the Census Bureau adopted a new Disclosure Avoidance
                                System (DAS) based on differential privacy. The DAS was designed to protect the
                                confidentiality of responses by injecting statistical noise into a confidential
                                individual census dataset. A key output of this system is the Noisy Measurement File
                                (NMF), which is produced by adding random noise to tabulated statistics. The resulting
                                Noisy Measurement File (NMF) is an invaluable resource for Census data users to
                                understand the error introduced by the DAS and perform statistically valid analyses that
                                properly account for DAS-introduced error.

                                The Bureau did not initially release the NMF, but released a demonstration version in
                                April 2023 after several public requests and subsequent litigation. The Bureau plans to
                                release the NMF for the P.L.94-171 redistricting data and more detailed census data (the
                                DHC file) later this year.

                                We commend the Bureau's decision to provide the NMF, which will help advance social
                                science research, improve policy decisions, and further strengthen the DAS itself. To
                                maximize the benefits of the released NMF, however, we believe that the Bureau must
                                substantially improve the way in which the NMF is formatted and released. In a letter
                                recently published in Science, we explain several obstacles researchers may face when
                                accessing, processing, and using the demonstration data for statistical analyses.</em>

                                video-sharing website -- from 1,012 places and 2,861 distinct governments across the
                                United States between 2006-2022. The data are processed, downloaded, cleaned, and
                                publicly disseminated at <a href="https://localview.net">localview.net</a> for analysis
                                across places and over time. We validate this dataset using a variety of methods and
                                demonstrate how it can be used to map local governments' attention to policy areas of
                                interest. Finally, we discuss how LocalView may be used by journalists, academics, and

                                on topics including climate change, public health, and immigration.</em>

                            <em> In "Differential Perspectives: Epistemic Disconnects Surrounding the US Census Bureau's
                                Use of Differential Privacy," boyd and Sarathy argue that empirical evaluations of the
                                Census Disclosure Avoidance System (DAS), including our published analysis, failed to
                                recognize how the benchmark data against which the 2020 DAS was evaluated is never a
                                ground truth of population counts. In this commentary, we explain why policy evaluation,
                                which was the main goal of our analysis, is still meaningful without access to a perfect
                                ground truth. We also point out that our evaluation leveraged features specific to the
                                decennial Census and redistricting data, such as block-level population invariance under
                                swapping and voter file racial identification, better approximating a comparison with
                                the ground truth. Lastly, we show that accurate statistical predictions of individual
                                race based on the Bayesian Improved Surname Geocoding, while not a violation of
                                differential privacy, substantially increases the disclosure risk of private information
                                the Census Bureau sought to protect. We conclude by arguing that policy makers must
                                confront a key trade-off between data utility and privacy protection, and an epistemic
                                disconnect alone is insufficient to explain disagreements between policy choices.</em>

                                Methodology (ALARM) Project. The 50stateSimulations allow for the evaluation of enacted
                                and other congressional redistricting plans in the United States. While the use of
                                redistricting simulation algorithms has become standard in academic research and court
                                cases, any simulation analysis requires non-trivial eforts to combine multiple data
                                sets, identify state-specifc redistricting criteria, implement complex simulation
                                algorithms, and summarize and visualize simulation outputs. We have developed a complete

                            <em> We study presidential patronage as a form of distributive politics. To do so, we
                                introduce comprehensive data on supervisory personnel in the executive branch between
                                1925 and 1959 and link each bureaucrat to the congressional representative from their
                                home district. We identify testable hypotheses regarding the impact of electoral
                                considerations, partisanship, and legislative support on the distribution of
                                bureaucratic appointments across districts. Results from a variety of fixed-effects
                                estimation strategies are consistent with several forms of presidential patronage. Our
                                results provide initial evidence about the mechanisms through which patronage
                                appointments are administered in the executive branch and illustrate how presidential
                                politics affects the composition of the federal government.</em>

                            <em> Census statistics play a key role in public policy decisions and social science
                                research. Yet given the risk of revealing individual information, many statistical
                                agencies are considering disclosure control methods based on differential privacy, which
                                add noise to tabulated data. Unlike other applications of differential privacy, however,
                                census statistics must be post-processed after noise injection to be usable. We study
                                the impact of the US Census Bureau's new Disclosure Avoidance System (DAS) on a major
                                application of census statistics: the redrawing of electoral districts. We find that the
                                DAS systematically undercounts the population in mixed-race and mixed-partisan
                                precincts, yielding unpredictable racial and partisan biases. The DAS also leads to a
                                likely violation of "One Person, One Vote" standard as currently interpreted, but does
                                not prevent accurate predictions of an individual's race and ethnicity. Our findings
                                underscore the difficulty of balancing accuracy and respondent privacy in the
                                Census.</em>

                                Public officials influence policymaking by choosing which items receive attention and
                                action -- and which do not. Accounts from national legislatures typically explain agenda
                                control in terms of party leadership and discipline. But, do politicians exert agenda
                                control outside highly professionalized legislatures? We bring the agenda control
                                discussion to school boards, which generally lack strong party control and feature few
                                restrictions on agendas. We argue that local officials will increase their use of
                                procedural rules to avoid making decisions in conflictual settings. We test our argument
                                by constructing measures of both agenda control and conflict in a dataset of nearly
                                65,000 school board meeting transcripts. Consistent with our theory, we document an
                                increased use of procedural control in highly contentious meetings. Responses from these
                                school board members to a novel survey experiment confirm the causal link: they increase
                                their use of tabling when conflict occurs on an issue.

                                Many of the most tangible and immediate political conflicts in American's lives occur
                                at the local level. Yet, we lack large-scale evidence on how, why, and where
                                conflict occurs in local governments. In this paper, we present a new dataset of
                                nearly 100,000 videos of school board meetings, and a new measure of local political
                                conflict. We use and validate this new approach using sentiment analysis and
                                structural topic modeling. We then document consistent results: conflict in school
                                board meetings broadly occurs at some point for most school boards, but the most
                                intense conflicts are concentrated in small numbers of districts; this conflict
                                often centers cultural issues like racial diversity and gender identity. We then
                                show that conflict, particularly cultural conflict, is most likely to occur in
                                larger school districts in cities and suburbs, in places with more white students,
                                and in places with more political competition.

                                a process commonly known as gerrymandering. To address this problem, several states have
                                implemented institutional reforms including the establishment of map-drawing
                                commissions. It is difficult to assess the impact of such reforms because each state
                                structures bundles of complex rules in different ways. We propose to model redistricting
                                processes as a sequential game. The equilibrium solution to the game summarizes
                                multi-step institutional interactions as a single dimensional score. This score measures
                                the leeway political actors have over the partisan lean of the final plan. Using a
                                differences-in-differences design, we demonstrate that reforms reduce partisan bias and
                                increase competitiveness when they constrain partisan actors. We perform a
                                counterfactual policy analysis to estimate the partisan effects of enacting recent
                                institutional reforms nationwide. We find that instituting redistricting commissions
                                generally reduces the current Republican advantage, but Michigan-style reforms would
                                yield a much greater pro-Democratic effect than types of redistricting commissions
                                adopted in Ohio and New York.

                            <em> We examine the effects of a “fact-specific proxy” (FSP) introduced by Virginia’s
                                Department of Housing and Community Development (VA DHCD) to broaden and streamline
                                access to assistance. The FSP used the applicant’s ZIP code as a proxy for income
                                eligibility, simplifying the requirement of documenting income eligibility for some
                                applicants and not others. Simplifying income eligibility verification represents a
                                substantial documentation burden reduction. Our general goal in the project is to ask:
                                to what extent does simplifying the individual requirement to document income
                                eligibility for applicants in relevant zip codes increase applications (especially among
                                underserved groups) and reduce processing times? We analyze application data aggregated
                                to the ZIP code level in order to answer this question.</em>

                                <p>On January 31, 2019, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), the
                                    U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York (SDNY within DOJ), the
                                    New York City Housing Authority (NYCHA), and New York City (the City) signed an
                                    agreement to help NYCHA significantly improve housing conditions for its residents.
                                    Housing conditions targeted for improvement ranged from lead paint to heat to pest
                                    infestations. In turn, unsafe housing conditions can harm public housing residents'
                                    health, increasing their risk for conditions such as childhood and adult asthma.</p>

                                <p>Measuring improvement in pest conditions is difficult because there was no “pest
                                    census” at the time of the agreement—that is, no complete account of the presence or
                                    absence of pests in all units, buildings, and developments. Meanwhile, the
                                    administrative agreement requires that NYCHA reduces its pest population by certain
                                    magnitudes (e.g., 40-50% depending on the pest type), which makes it important to
                                    obtain unbiased measures of pest prevalence. Our collaboration focused on
                                    methodologies that could be used to monitor: (1) the baseline levels of pest
                                    infestations at the beginning of the legal oversight and (2) whether there are
                                    improvements over time. We explored the pros and cons of four strategies for
                                    estimating this prevalence: (1) using tenant-submitted work orders as measures of
                                    underlying issues, (2) using results from randomly-scheduled inspections, (3) using
                                    results from randomly-scheduled inspections but reweighting these results to account
                                    for unequal probabilities of being selected for an inspection and agreeing to have
                                    one's unit inspected, and (4) using predictive modeling to see whether we can
                                    predict inspection results using many predictors (e.g., work order history; building
                                    characteristics). We are preparing a manuscript that discusses broader lessons for
                                    the role of data science in monitoring compliance with legal oversight and provides
                                    recommendations for academics and policymakers</p>
